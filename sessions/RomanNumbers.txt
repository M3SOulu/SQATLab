The Romans were a clever bunch. 
They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. 
One thing they never discovered though was the number zero. 
This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, 
but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today.  
The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.   


Write a function to convert from normal to Roman Numerals:
1 -> I 
10 -> X
 7 -> VII 
and so on…

Note that you can't write numerals like "IM" for 999.
Wikipedia says: 
Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with 
the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. 
To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990. 
In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 
2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII.

# Remember unit-testing?

---------------------

### Tests as a collaboration tool between the customers and engineers


# Enter Behaviour DD

> Storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it  
(Hannah Arendt, _Men in dark times_)

# User story
* Use of examples to describe the behaviour of the system
* Written together by customers and developers
* Automated acceptance criteria 

# Example 1/2
_As a_ student  
_I want to_ access my grades  
_So that_ I do not need to disturb the teacher

# Example 2/2
_Given_ I am logged in [Weboodi]  
_When_ I press the “My courses” button  
_Then_ I should see the grades of my courses



# Enter Acceptance TDD

> Acceptance tests specify what needs to be achieved in order to consider the story done

---------------------------

# An acceptance test is:
- Owned by the customers
- Written by customers and engineers
- Focusing on the _what_ not _how_
- Written using the language of the domain
- Concise, precise, unambiguous 

# TDD + BDD/ATDD
> * _Are we building the thing right?_ (TDD)
> * _Are we building the right thing?_ (BDD/ATDD)

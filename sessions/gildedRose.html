<p>Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures.</p>
<p>Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items.</p>
<p>First an introduction to our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>All items have a <em>SellIn</em> value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item</li>
<li>All items have a <em>Quality</em> value which denotes how valuable the item is</li>
<li>At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the sell by date has passed, <em>Quality</em> degrades twice as fast</li>
<li>The <em>Quality</em> of an item is never negative</li>
<li><em>Aged Brie</em> actually increases in <em>Quality</em> the older it gets</li>
<li>The <em>Quality</em> of an item is never more than 50</li>
<li><em>Sulfuras</em>, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in <em>Quality</em></li>
<li><em>Backstage passes</em>, like aged brie, increases in <em>Quality</em> as its <em>SellIn</em> approaches. Its <em>Quality</em> increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but <em>Quality</em> drops to 0 after the concert</li>
</ul>
<p>We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conjured</em> items degrade in <em>Quality</em> twice as fast as normal items</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to make any changes to the <em>UpdateQuality</em> method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not alter the <em>Item</em> class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership (you can make the <em>UpdateQuality</em> method and <em>Items</em> property static if you like, we'll cover for you).</p>
<p>Just for clarification, an item can never have its <em>Quality</em> increase above 50, however <em>Sulfuras</em> is a legendary item and as such its <em>Quality</em> is 80 and it never alters.</p>

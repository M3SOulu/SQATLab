<h1>MusicPhone Quick facts</h1>

<p>The project is divided in several packages </p>

<p><strong>app</strong> – Package containing the UI resources and classes that provide data from Last.FM. </p>

<p><strong>commons</strong> - Package containing the data models, interfaces and logic modules used by the MusicPhone UI and tests. You will implement the missing logic inside this project. You may not change any of the interfaces or the DeviceManager. You may extend the behaviour of the Recommender, but without changing its existing behaviour or its interface. You may add one or more classes here if required (for 2nd and 3th part of the project).</p>

<p><strong>commons.dataClasses</strong> – Package containing the basic classes representing the entities present in MusicPhone</p>

<p><strong>commons.interfaces</strong> – Package containing the interfaces from that are implemented by the different parts of this system. You should not change any of those.</p>

<p><strong>commons.xmlData</strong> – Package containing the dump of Last.FM response for the API necessary to solve the task in XML format. Those are useful for testing purposes.</p>

<p><strong>commons.dataConnectors</strong> – Package containing the implementation of <em>IConnector</em> (<em>LastFmXmlConnector</em>) methods to parse the Last.FM XML files. You may want to instantiate such class for testing purposes.</p>

<p><strong>gps</strong>, <strong>player</strong> and <strong>recommender</strong> – Packages containing the UIs for the application main components. The UI is bounded to a class (e.g. <em>GpsUI.java</em> and <em>Gps.java)</em> which is the implementation of the interfaces present in commons.interfaces</p>

<h3>Before you start</h3>

<h4>Initialization of components</h4>

<p>The application project creates concrete instances of <em>IPlayer</em>, <em>IGps</em>, and <em>IRecommender</em> objects. These instances persist when the application is running. The application will set the <em>Connector</em> property of the <em>Recommender</em> object to an instance of <em>LastFmXmlConnector</em>, which implements the <em>IConnector</em> interface.</p>

<h4>The IConnector interface</h4>

<p>Defines access to XML data from Last.FM. The <em>IConnector</em> class you need to test your implementation with preloaded XML data is <em>LastFmXmlConnector</em>. This class has a 0-argument constructor To access the XML data from Commons, use the <em>Connector</em> property of the <em>Recommender</em> class. </p>

<h4>The XML data for testing</h4>

<p>Located in the XmlData folder of the Commons package. The <em>LastFmXmlConnector</em> class accesses the files in this folder.</p>

<h4>DeviceManager</h4>

<p>Provides singleton access to instances of the <em>IPlayer</em> and <em>IGps</em> objects. When these objects are instantiated by the Application, they register themselves with the <em>DeviceManager</em>.<br>

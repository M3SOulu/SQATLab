<h1>Sudoku verifier</h1>
  </div>
<p>Sudoku is a game with few simple rules, where the goal is to place nine sets of positive digits (1...9) into the cells of a fixed grid structure (i.e. board).</p>
<p>The Sudoku board (or global grid) consists of a 3x3 arrangement of sub-grids, and each sub-grid is a 3x3 arrangement of cells. This yields a 9x9 arrangement of cells on the Sudoku board.</p>
<p>A valid Sudoku solution should conform to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>R1: A cell in a Sudoku game can only store positive digits, i.e. 1...9.</li>
<li>R2: All digits appear only once in a sub-grid, i.e. they cannot repeat.</li>
<li>R3: A digit can appear only once in the rows of the global grid.</li>
<li>R4: A digit can appear only once in the columns of the global grid.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your task is to check the validity of a given solution for a Sudoku game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You should read the candidate solution from a string variable, which should be exactly 81 characters long, i.e. first 9 are the first row, second 9 are the second row etc.</li>
<li>You shall check whether the provided string follows the correct format (i.e. 9 rows with 9 entries in each row).</li>
<li>You shall check the validity of the candidate solution against the rules listed above.</li>
<li>You program shall provide the functionality to return an integer code on the validity of the solution:
<ul>
<li>Return 0: means it is a valid Sudoku solution</li>
<li>Return -1: means it is violating Rule #1</li>
<li>Return -2: means it is violating Rule #2</li>
<li>Return -3: means it is violating Rule #3</li>
<li>Return -4: means it is violating Rule #4</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You should implement the functionality with a single API method with the following signature:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>public int verify(String candidateSolution)</code></p>
An incorrect Sudoku string: 123456789912345678891234567789123456678912345567891234456789123345678912234567891

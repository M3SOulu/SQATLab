<h1>Recommend artists</h1>
</div>
<p>Implement the <em>getRecommendations</em> method of the <em>Recommender</em> class. </p>

<p>MusicPhone recommends artists based on the favourite artists of Last.FM users who are the top fans of the currently-playing artist on the user’s player. MusicPhone recommends the 20 most-frequently-appearing artists among those fans’ top artists (as in “people who like this artist also like these other artists…”). </p>

<p>The method <em>getRecommendations</em> should return a list of <em>Recommendation</em> objects. Each <em>Recommendation</em> object consists of an artist’s name (<em>artist</em>) and the frequency of occurrence (<em>fanCount</em>) of that artist. </p>

<p>You will need to use IConnector’s <em>getTopFansForArtist</em> and <em>getTopArtistsByFan</em> methods to implement this method. </p>

<p>Example: Suppose the currently playing artist is Cher. Suppose John, Sally, and Tom are the only top fans of Cher. If Tom and John both like U2 as well, then getRecommendations should return a list that includes a recommendation containing U2 with a FanCount of 2. </p>

<p><em>Acceptance tests</em></p>

<p>For U2, your list should include among others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Radiohead</li>
<li>Pink Floyd</li>
</ul>
<p>The list should have 20 results. Madonna should not be on the list 
</p>
<p>For Metallica, your list should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Iron Maiden (19 fans)</li>
<li>Nightwish (15 fans)</li>
</ul>

<p>For Coldplay you should return exactly 2 recommendations</p>

## Gilded Rose 
Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures. 

Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can begin selling a new category of items.   
First an introduction to our system:* All items have a _SellIn_ value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item* All items have a _Quality_ value which denotes how valuable the item is* At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:
* Once the sell by date has passed, _Quality_ degrades twice as fast
* The _Quality_ of an item is never negative* _Aged Brie_ actually increases in _Quality_ the older it gets 
* The _Quality_ of an item is never more than 50* _Sulfuras_, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in _Quality_* _Backstage passes_, like aged brie, increases in Quality as its _SellIn_ approaches. Its _Quality_ increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but _Quality_ drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:* _Conjured_ items degrade in _Quality_ twice as fast as normal items
Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any new code as long as everything still works correctly. However, do not alter the _Item_ class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership (you can make the _UpdateQuality_ method and _Items_ property static if you like, we'll cover for you). 
Just for clarification, an item can never have its _Quality_ increase above 50, however _Sulfuras_ is a legendary item and as such its _Quality_ is 80 and it never alters.
